// of that works, so what is checked here is that a build never asks: a
// build that can is refused before it is signed, and no app installs a
// build that is not signed, see updates.Verify. sign runs from main, see publish.yml, so
// these lists are main's, and a branch that changes them changes nothing
// about how its own build is judged.
//
// What this cannot catch is code that hides the name it looks up, built
// from pieces at run time. Then macOS is the wall that holds: none of
// these inputs works without the person allowing it in System Settings.
