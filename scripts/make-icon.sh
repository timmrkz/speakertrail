# The source is build/icon.png, one square 1024 by 1024 image with
# transparency, and it is the only file anybody ever has to change. What
# comes out is an .icns, which is not an image but a container holding the
# same artwork at ten sizes, from 16 to 1024. macOS picks which one the
# Dock, Finder, Spotlight and the switcher each get, so drawing one and
# letting it be scaled is not the same thing at all.
#
# Both tools are on every Mac already. sips resizes, iconutil packs. The
# .icns is build output and is not in the repository. Taken from
# FrameFairy.
#
# The rounded square fills about 824 of the 1024, centred, with the rest
# left for the shadow the system draws, the grid FrameFairy's icon was
# checked on in the Dock.
