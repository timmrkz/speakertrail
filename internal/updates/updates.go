// Package updates is how the app finds, checks and fetches a newer build of
// itself. The swap is Wails' updater's, pkg/updater: this package is the
// source it reads from, the channel list, and the signing the build
// workflow does on the other end. See docs/UPDATES.md.
//
// A channel is main or one pull request. The build workflow publishes each
// channel's newest build of the app as a zip, and one small public file,
// the channel list, says for every channel which build that is, where it
// is, and its checksum and signature. The app fetches that one file. It
// never asks GitHub's API and has no idea what a pull request is.
//
// The channel list is untrusted: anybody on the way could change it. What
// makes a build safe to install is the signature, made with a key only the
// build workflow holds, over the SHA-256 of the zip. The public half is
// built into the app and Wails' updater checks it before anything is
// unpacked, so a list that points somewhere else can only point at a file
// that fails.
