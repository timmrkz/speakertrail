// Chrome is where macOS put its own furniture, the title bar and its
// buttons, in whole CSS pixels, measured rather than guessed.
//
// The app draws its own bar across its top and macOS draws the close,
// minimise and zoom buttons on top of it. Nothing public moves those
// buttons: the height the app asks macOS to leave empty only says how far
// down a drag still moves the app, and the one thing that does
// decide where they sit, the title bar AppKit lays out, is AppKit's to
// lay out. So the bar stops trying to be a height of its own and becomes
// exactly the title bar, which centres the buttons in it by construction,
// on every version of macOS and at every control size.
//
// There is no middle of the buttons to tell. AppKit's frame for the
// close button is on the bar's middle while macOS draws the circles a
// point lower, under the window's edge, so the stylesheet centres the
// name there itself, see .titlebar in PrivateApp.svelte. The frame is
// still logged.
//
// All zeros mean the system draws its own title bar, which is every other
// system, and then the stylesheet keeps its own numbers.
